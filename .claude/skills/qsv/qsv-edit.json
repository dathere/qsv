For example we have the following CSV file named items.csv: item,color shoes,blue flashlight,gray To output the data with the color of the shoes as green instead of blue, run: The following is returned as output: item,color shoes,green flashlight,gray You may also choose to specify the column name by its index (in this case 1). Specifying a column as a number is prioritized by index rather than name. If there is no newline (\\n) at the end of the input data, it may be added to the output.",
