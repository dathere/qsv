  "name": "qsv-fetchpost",
  "version": "12.0.0",
  "description": "Fetchpost sends/fetches data to/from web services for every row using HTTP Post. As opposed to fetch, which uses HTTP Get. CSV data is posted using two methods: 1. As an HTML Form using using the <column-list> argument The columns are used to construct the HTML form data and posted to the server as a URL-encoded form. (content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) 2. As a payload using a MiniJinja template with the --payload-tpl <file> option The template file is used to construct the payload and posted to the server as JSON by default (content-type: application/json), with automatic checking if the rendered template is valid JSON. The --content-type option can override the expected content type. However, it is the user's responsibility to ensure the content-type format is valid. Fetchpost is integrated with `jaq` (a jq clone) to directly parse out values from an API JSON response. (See https://github.com/01mf02/jaq for more info on how to use the jaq JSON Query Language) CACHE OPTIONS: Fetchpost caches responses to minimize traffic and maximize performance. It has four mutually-exclusive caching options: 1. In memory cache (the default) 2. Disk cache 3. Redis cache 4. No cache In memory Cache: In memory cache is the default and is used if no caching option is set. It uses a non-persistent, in-memory, 2 million entry Least Recently Used (LRU) cache for each fetch session. To change the maximum number of entries in the cache, set the --mem-cache-size option. Disk Cache: For persistent, inter-session caching, a DiskCache can be enabled with the --disk-cache flag. By default, it will store the cache in the directory ~/.qsv/cache/fetchpost, with a cache expiry Time-to-Live (TTL) of 2,419,200 seconds (28 days), and cache hits NOT refreshing the TTL of cached values. Set the --disk-cache-dir option and the environment variables QSV_DISKCACHE_TTL_SECS and QSV_DISKCACHE_TTL_REFRESH to change default DiskCache settings. Redis Cache: Another persistent, inter-session cache option is a Redis cache enabled with the --redis flag. By default, it will connect to a local Redis instance at redis://127.0.0.1:6379/2, with a cache expiry Time-to-Live (TTL) of 2,419,200 seconds (28 days), and cache hits NOT refreshing the TTL of cached values. Set the environment variables QSV_FP_REDIS_CONNSTR, QSV_REDIS_TTL_SECONDS and QSV_REDIS_TTL_REFRESH to change default Redis settings. Note that the default values are the same as the fetch command, except fetchpost creates the cache at database 2, as opposed to database 1 with fetch. If you don't want responses to be cached at all, use the --no-cache flag. NETWORK OPTIONS: Fetchpost recognizes RateLimit and Retry-After headers and dynamically throttles requests to be as fast as allowed. The --rate-limit option sets the maximum number of queries per second (QPS) to be made. The default is 0, which means to go as fast as possible, automatically throttling as required, based on rate-limit and retry-after response headers. To use a proxy, please set env vars HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY or ALL_PROXY (e.g. export HTTPS_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1086). qsv fetchpost supports brotli, gzip and deflate automatic decompression for improved throughput and performance, preferring brotli over gzip over deflate. Gzip compression of requests bodies is supported with the --compress flag. Note that public APIs typically do not support gzip compression of request bodies because of the \"zip bomb\" vulnerability. This option should only be used with private APIs where this is not a concern. It automatically upgrades its connection to the much faster and more efficient HTTP/2 protocol with adaptive flow control if the server supports it. See https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/http2-vs-http1.1/ and https://medium.com/coderscorner/http-2-flow-control-77e54f7fd518 for more info. URL OPTIONS: <url-column> needs to be a fully qualified URL path. It can be specified as a column name from which the URL value will be retrieved for each record, or as the URL literal itself. EXAMPLES: data.csv URL, zipcode, country https://httpbin.org/post, 90210, USA https://httpbin.org/post, 94105, USA https://httpbin.org/post, 92802, USA Given the data.csv above, fetch the JSON response. Note the output will be a JSONL file - with a minified JSON response per line, not a CSV file. Now, if we want to generate a CSV file with a parsed response - getting only the \"form\" property, we use the new-column and jaq options. data_with_response.csv URL,zipcode,country,form https://httpbin.org/post,90210,USA,\"{\"\"country\"\": String(\"\"USA\"\"), \"\"zipcode\"\": String(\"\"90210\"\")}\" https://httpbin.org/post,94105,USA,\"{\"\"country\"\": String(\"\"USA\"\"), \"\"zipcode\"\": String(\"\"94105\"\")}\" https://httpbin.org/post,92802,USA,\"{\"\"country\"\": String(\"\"USA\"\"), \"\"zipcode\"\": String(\"\"92802\"\")}\" Alternatively, since we're using the same URL for all the rows, we can just pass the url directly on the command-line. Also note that for the column-list argument, we used the column index (2,3 for second & third column) instead of using the column names, and we loaded the jaq selector from the form.jaq file. The form.jaq file simply contains the string literal \".form\", including the enclosing double quotes: form.jaq \".form\" USING THE HTTP-HEADER OPTION: The --http-header option allows you to append arbitrary key value pairs (a valid pair is a key and value separated by a colon) to the HTTP header (to authenticate against an API, pass custom header fields, etc.). Note that you can pass as many key-value pairs by using --http-header option repeatedly.
