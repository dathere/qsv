  "description": "Prints flattened records such that fields are labeled separated by a new line. This mode is particularly useful for viewing one record at a time. Each record is separated by a special '#' character (on a line by itself), which can be changed with the --separator flag. There is also a condensed view (-c or --condense) that will shorten the contents of each field to provide a summary view. For examples, see https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/tests/test_flatten.rs.",
