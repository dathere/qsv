  "description": "Creates an index of the given CSV data, which can make other operations like slicing, splitting and gathering statistics much faster. Note that this does not accept CSV data on stdin. You must give a file path. The index is created at 'path/to/input.csv.idx'. The index will be automatically used by commands that can benefit from it. If the original CSV data changes after the index is made, commands that try to use it will result in an error (you have to regenerate the index before it can be used again). However, if the environment variable QSV_AUTOINDEX_SIZE is set, qsv will automatically create an index when the input file size >= specified size (bytes). It will also automatically update stale indices as well.",
