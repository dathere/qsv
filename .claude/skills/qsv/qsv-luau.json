  "version": "13.0.0",
  "description": "Create multiple new computed columns, filter rows or compute aggregations by executing a Luau 0.702 script for every row (SEQUENTIAL MODE) or for specified rows (RANDOM ACCESS MODE) of a CSV file. Luau is not just another qsv command. It is qsv's Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for data-wrangling. 👑 The executed Luau has 3 ways to reference row columns (as strings): 1. Directly by using column name (e.g. Amount), can be disabled with --no-globals 2. Indexing col variable by column name: col.Amount or col[\"Total Balance\"] 3. Indexing col variable by column 1-based index: col[1], col[2], etc. This is only available with the --colindex or --no-headers options. Of course, if your input has no headers, then 3. will be the only available option. It has two subcommands: map     - Create new columns by mapping the result of a Luau script for each row. filter  - Filter rows by executing a Luau script for each row. Rows that return true are kept, the rest are filtered out. Some examples: Sum numeric columns 'a' and 'b' and call new column 'c' There is some magic in the previous example as 'a' and 'b' are passed in as strings (not numbers), but Luau still manages to add them up. A more explicit way of doing it, is by using the tonumber() function. See https://luau-lang.org/library for a list of built-in functions. Add running total column for Amount Or use the --begin and --end options to compute the running & grand totals \"tot = tot + Amount; gtotal = gtotal + tot; return tot\" --end \"return gtotal\" Add running total column for Amount when previous balance was 900 Use the qsv_cumsum() helper function to compute the running total. See https://github.com/dathere/qsv/wiki/Luau-Helper-Functions-Examples for more examples. Convert Amount to always-positive AbsAmount and Type (debit/credit) columns \"if tonumber(Amount) < 0 then return 'debit' else return 'credit' end\" | \\ qsv luau map AbsAmount \"math.abs(tonumber(Amount))\" Map multiple new columns in one pass Filter some rows based on numerical filtering PATTERN MATCHING WITH string.find AND OTHER STRING FUNCTIONS: Lua/Luau string functions like string.find, string.match, string.gsub use PATTERN MATCHING by default, where certain characters have special meanings: ( ) . % + - * ? [ ] ^ $ If you need to search for these characters literally, you have two options: 1. Escape special characters with % (percent sign): 2. Use plain text mode (4th parameter = true): Common gotchas: - Parentheses in names like \"Jane (Smith)\" need escaping or plain mode - Dots in email addresses, URLs, or decimal numbers - Hyphens in phone numbers or dates For more on Lua patterns: https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1 Typing long scripts on the command line gets tiresome rather quickly. Use the \"file:\" prefix or the \".lua/.luau\" file extension to read non-trivial scripts from the filesystem. In the following example, both the BEGIN and END scripts have the lua/luau file extension so they are read from the filesystem.  With the debitcredit.script file, we use the \"file:\" prefix to read it from the filesystem. With \"luau map\", if the MAIN script is invalid for a row, \"<ERROR>\" followed by a detailed error message is returned for that row. With \"luau filter\", if the MAIN script is invalid for a row, that row is not filtered. If any row has an invalid result, an exitcode of 1 is returned and an error count is logged. SPECIAL VARIABLES: \"_IDX\" - a READ-only variable that is zero during the BEGIN script and set to the current row number during the MAIN & END scripts. It is primarily used in SEQUENTIAL MODE when the CSV has no index or you wish to process the CSV sequentially. \"_INDEX\" - a READ/WRITE variable that enables RANDOM ACCESS MODE when used in a script. Using \"_INDEX\" in a script switches qsv to RANDOM ACCESS MODE where setting it to a row number will change the current row to the specified row number. It will only work, however, if the CSV has an index. When using _INDEX, the MAIN script will keep looping and evaluate the row specified by _INDEX until _INDEX is set to an invalid row number (e.g. <= zero or to a value greater than _ROWCOUNT). If the CSV has no index, qsv will abort with an error unless \"qsv_autoindex()\" is called in the BEGIN script to create an index. \"_ROWCOUNT\" - a READ-only variable which is zero during the BEGIN & MAIN scripts, and set to the rowcount during the END script when the CSV has no index (SEQUENTIAL MODE). When using _INDEX and the CSV has an index, _ROWCOUNT will be set to the rowcount of the CSV file, even from the BEGINning (RANDOM ACCESS MODE). \"_LASTROW\" - a READ-only variable that is set to the last row number of the CSV. Like _INDEX, it will also trigger RANDOM ACCESS MODE if used in a script. Similarly, if the CSV has no index, qsv will also abort with an error unless \"qsv_autoindex()\" is called in the BEGIN script to create an index. For security and safety reasons as a purpose-built embeddable interpreter, Luau's standard library is relatively minimal (https://luau-lang.org/library). That's why qsv bundles & preloads LuaDate v2.2.1 as date manipulation is a common task. See https://tieske.github.io/date/ on how to use the LuaDate library. Additional libraries can be loaded using Luau's \"require\" function. See https://github.com/LewisJEllis/awesome-lua for a list of other libraries. With the judicious use of \"require\", the BEGIN script & special variables, one can create variables, tables, arrays & functions that can be used for complex aggregation operations in the END script. SCRIPT DEVELOPMENT TIPS: When developing Luau scripts, be sure to take advantage of the \"qsv_log\" function to debug your script. It will log messages at the level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG, TRACE) specified by the QSV_LOG_LEVEL environment variable (see docs/Logging.md for details). At the DEBUG level, the log messages will be more verbose to facilitate debugging. It will also skip precompiling the MAIN script to bytecode so you can see more detailed error messages with line numbers. Bear in mind that qsv strips comments from Luau scripts before executing them. This is done so qsv doesn't falsely trigger on special variables mentioned in comments. When checking line numbers in DEBUG mode, be sure to refer to the comment-stripped scripts in the log file, not the original commented scripts. There are more Luau helper functions in addition to \"qsv_log\", notably the powerful \"qsv_register_lookup\" which allows you to \"lookup\" values against other CSVs on the filesystem, a URL, datHere's lookup repo or CKAN instances. Detailed descriptions of these helpers can be found in the \"setup_helpers\" section at the bottom of this file and on the Wiki (https://github.com/dathere/qsv/wiki) For more detailed examples, see https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/tests/test_luau.rs.",
