  "description": "Select columns from CSV data efficiently. This command lets you manipulate the columns in CSV data. You can re-order, duplicate, reverse or drop them. Columns can be referenced by index or by name if there is a header row (duplicate column names can be disambiguated with more indexing). Column ranges can also be specified. Finally, columns can be selected using regular expressions. Select the first and fourth columns: Select the first 4 columns (by index and by name): Ignore the first 2 columns (by range and by omission): Select the third column named 'Foo': Select the first and last columns, _ is a special character for the last column: Reverse the order of columns: Sort the columns lexicographically (i.e. by their byte values) Select some columns and then sort them: Randomly shuffle the columns: Select some columns and then shuffle them with a seed: Select columns using a regex using '/<regex>/': Re-order and duplicate columns arbitrarily using different types of selectors: Quote column names that conflict with selector syntax:",
