  "description": "Quickly sniff the first n rows and infer CSV metadata (delimiter, header row, number of preamble rows, quote character, flexible, is_utf8, average record length, number of records, content length and estimated number of records if sniffing a URL, file size, number of fields, field names & data types) using a Viterbi algorithm. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm) `sniff` is also a mime type detector, returning the detected mime type, file size and last modified date. If --no-infer is enabled, it doesn't even bother to infer the CSV's schema. This makes it useful for accelerated CKAN harvesting and for checking stale/broken resource URLs. It detects more than 120 mime types, including CSV, MS Office/Open Document files, JSON, XML, PDF, PNG, JPEG and specialized geospatial formats like GPX, GML, KML, TML, TMX, TSX, TTML. see https://docs.rs/file-format/latest/file_format/#reader-features NOTE: This command \"sniffs\" a CSV's schema by sampling the first n rows (default: 1000) of a file. Its inferences are sometimes wrong if the the file is too small to infer a pattern or if the CSV has unusual formatting - with atypical delimiters, quotes, etc. In such cases, selectively use the --sample, --delimiter and --quote options to improve the accuracy of the sniffed schema. If you want more robust, guaranteed schemata, use the \"schema\" or \"stats\" commands instead as they scan the entire file. However, they only work on local files and well-formed CSVs, unlike `sniff` which can work with remote files, various CSV dialects and is very fast regardless of file size. For examples, see https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/tests/test_sniff.rs.",
