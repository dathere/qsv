> ℹ️ **NOTE:** qsv is a fork of the popular [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) utility, merging several pending PRs [since xsv 0.13.0's May 2018 release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/issues/267). On top of xsv's 20 commands, it adds numerous new features, 27 additional commands, 6 `apply` subcommands & 32 `apply` operations (for a total of 85).
See [FAQ](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/categories/faq) for more details.

## Installation

For [macOS and Linux (64-bit)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qsv), you can quickly install qsv with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). However, only the `apply` [feature](#feature-flags) is enabled and its qsv v0.70.0.

```
brew install qsv
```

Prebuilt binary variants of the latest qsv version with more enabled features for Windows, Linux & macOS are also available [for download](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/releases/latest), including binaries compiled with [Rust Nightly/Unstable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70745970/rust-nightly-vs-beta-version) ([more info](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/docs/PERFORMANCE.md#nightly-release-builds)).

There are three variants of qsv:
 * `qsv` - [feature](#feature-flags) capable, with the [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/releases/latest) enabling all applicable features except Python [^7]
 * `qsvlite` - all features disabled (~half the size of `qsv`)
 * `qsvdp` - optimized for use with [DataPusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus), with only DataPusher+ relevant commands & the self-update engine removed (~sixth of the size of `qsv`).

Alternatively, you can install from source by [installing Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and installing `qsv` using Rust's cargo command[^6]:

[^6]: Of course, you'll also need a linker & a C compiler. Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their distribution’s documentation.
For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install the `build-essential` package. On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running `$ xcode-select --install`.
For Windows, this means installing [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). When prompted for workloads, include "Desktop Development with C++",
the Windows 10 or 11 SDK & the English language pack, along with any other language packs your require.

```bash
cargo install qsv --locked --features all_full
```

The binary will be installed in `~/.cargo/bin`.

Compiling from source also works similarly:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jqnatividad/qsv.git
cd qsv
cargo build --release --locked --features all_full
```

The compiled binary will end up in `./target/release/`.

To enable optional features, use cargo `--features` (see [Feature Flags](#feature-flags) for more info):

```bash
cargo install qsv --locked --features apply,generate,luau,fetch,foreach,python,self_update,full
# or shorthand
cargo install qsv --locked --features all_full
# or to install qsvlite
cargo install qsv --locked --features lite
# or to install qsvdp
cargo install qsv --locked --features datapusher_plus

# or when compiling from a local repo
cargo build --release --locked --features apply,generate,luau,fetch,foreach,python,self_update,full
# shorthand
cargo build --release --locked --features all_full
# for qsvlite
cargo build --release --locked --features lite
# for qsvdp
cargo build --release --locked --features datapusher_plus
```

[^7]: The `foreach` feature is not available on Windows. The `python` feature is not enabled on the prebuilt binaries. Compile with Python 3.6 and above development environment installed if you want to enable the `python` feature. Lua support is enabled by default on the prebuilt binaries, with preference for `luau` for platforms that support it, with `luajit` as a fallback.  

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

qsv's MSRV policy is to require [Rust stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md) - currently version 1.65.

## Tab Completion

qsv's command-line options are quite extensive. Thankfully, since it uses [docopt](http://docopt.org/) for CLI processing,
we can take advantage of [docopt.rs' tab completion support](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs#tab-completion-support) to make it
easier to use qsv at the command-line (currently, only bash shell is supported):

```bash
# install docopt-wordlist
cargo install docopt

# IMPORTANT: run these commands from the root directory of your qsv git repository
# to setup bash qsv tab completion
echo "DOCOPT_WORDLIST_BIN=\"$(which docopt-wordlist)"\" >> $HOME/.bash_completion
echo "source \"$(pwd)/scripts/docopt-wordlist.bash\"" >> $HOME/.bash_completion
echo "complete -F _docopt_wordlist_commands qsv" >> $HOME/.bash_completion
```

## File formats

qsv recognizes UTF-8/ASCII encoded, CSV (`.csv`) & TSV files (`.tsv` & `.tab`). CSV files are assumed to have "," (comma) as a delimiter,
and TSV files, "\t" (tab) as a delimiter. The delimiter is a single ascii character that can be set either by the `--delimiter` command-line option or
with the `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` environment variable or automatically detected when `QSV_SNIFF_DELIMITER` is set.

When using the `--output` option, note that qsv will UTF-8 encode the file & automatically change the delimiter used in the generated file based on the file extension - i.e. comma for `.csv`, tab for `.tsv` & `.tab` files.

[JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/)/[NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) files are also recognized & converted to/from CSV with the [`jsonl`](/src/cmd/jsonl.rs#L11) and [`tojsonl`](/src/cmd/tojsonl.rs#L12) commands respectively.

The `fetch` & `fetchpost` commands also produces JSONL files when its invoked without the `--new-column` option & TSV files with the `--report` option.

The `sniff`, `sortcheck` & `validate` commands produce JSON files with their `--json` & `--pretty-json` options.

The `schema` command produces a [JSON Schema Validation (Draft 7)](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html) file with the ".schema.json" file extension, which can be used with the `validate` command.

The `excel` command recognizes Excel & Open Document Spreadsheet(ODS) files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlsb` & `.ods` files).

### RFC 4180

qsv validates against the [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) CSV standard. However IRL, CSV formats vary significantly & qsv is actually not strictly compliant with the specification so it can process "real-world" CSV files.
qsv leverages the awesome [Rust CSV](https://docs.rs/csv/latest/csv/) crate to read/write CSV files.

Click [here](https://docs.rs/csv-core/latest/csv_core/struct.Reader.html#rfc-4180) to find out more about how qsv conforms to the standard using this crate.

### **UTF-8 Encoding**

The following commands require UTF-8 encoded input (of which ASCII is a subset) - `dedup`, `exclude`, `fetch`, `fetchpost`, `frequency`, `join`, `schema`, `sort`, `stats` & `validate`.

For these commands, qsv checks if the input is UTF-8 encoded by scanning the first 8k & will abort if its not unless `QSV_SKIPUTF8_CHECK` is set. On Linux & macOS, UTF-8 encoding is the default.

This was done to increase performance of these commands, as they make extensive use of `from_utf8_unchecked` so as not to pay the repetitive utf-8 validation penalty, no matter how small, even for already utf-8 encoded files.

Should you need to re-encode CSV/TSV files, you can use the `input` command to transcode to UTF-8. It will replace all invalid UTF-8 sequences with `�`. Alternatively, there are several utilities you can use to do so on [Linux/macOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/805418/how-can-i-find-encoding-of-a-file-via-a-script-on-linux) & [Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/1163753/converting-text-file-to-utf-8-on-windows-command-prompt).

### **Windows Usage Note**

Unlike other modern operating systems, Microsoft Windows' [default encoding is UTF16-LE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66072117/why-does-windows-use-utf-16le). This will cause problems when redirecting qsv's output to a CSV file & trying to open it with Excel (which ignores the comma delimiter, with everything in the first column):

```
qsv stats wcp.csv > wcpstats.csv
```

Which is weird, since you would think [Microsoft's own Excel would properly recognize UTF16-LE encoded CSV files](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/opening-csv-file-with-utf16-encoding-in-excel-2010/ed522cb9-e88d-4b82-b88e-a2d4bd99f874?auth=1). Regardless, to create a properly UTF-8 encoded file, use the `--output` option instead:

```
# so instead of redirecting stdout to a file
qsv stats wcp.csv > wcpstats.csv

# do this instead
qsv stats wcp.csv --output wcpstats.csv
```


## Interpreters
### Python

The `python` feature is NOT enabled by default on the prebuilt binaries, as doing so requires it to statically link to python, which presents distribution issues, as various operating systems have differing bundled Python versions.

If you wish to enable the `python` feature - you'll just have to install/compile from source, making sure you have the development libraries for the desired Python version (Python 3.6 & up are supported) installed when doing so.

Note that if you plan to distribute your manually built `qsv` with the `python` feature, `qsv` will look for Python shared libraries (libpython* on Linux/macOS, python*.dll on Windows) against which it was compiled starting with the current directory & abort with an error if not found, detailing the Python library it was looking for. 

Note that this will happen as soon as the qsv binary is invoked, even if you're not running the `py` command.

[PyO3](https://pyo3.rs) - the underlying crate that enables the `python` feature, uses a build script to determine the Python version & set the correct linker arguments. By default it uses the python3 executable.
You can override the Python interpreter by setting `PYO3_PYTHON` (e.g., `PYO3_PYTHON=python3.6`), before installing/compiling qsv. See the [PyO3 User Guide](https://pyo3.rs/v0.17.1/building_and_distribution.html) for more information.

### Luau/LuaJIT

[Luau](https://luau-lang.org) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) at the [heart of Roblox technology](https://luau-lang.org/2022/11/04/luau-origins-and-evolution.html).

[LuaJIT](https://luajit.org) is a Just-In-Time compiler for Lua, with partial compatibility with Lua 5.2.

Consider using the `luau`/`luajit` commands instead of the `py` command if the operation you're trying to do can be done with `luau`/`luajit`. [Lua/Luau is much faster than Python](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/lua-python3.html) & [LuaJIT is even faster still](https://luajit.org/performance_x86.html). In addition, Luau/LuaJIT is embedded into qsv, can do aggregations with its `--prologue` & `--epilogue` options & has no external dependencies unlike Python.

The `py` command cannot do aggregations because [PyO3's GIL-bound memory](https://pyo3.rs/v0.17.2/memory.html#gil-bound-memory) limitations will quickly consume a lot of memory (see [issue 449](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/449#issuecomment-1226095316) for details).
To prevent this, the `py` command processes CSVs in batches (default: 30,000 records), with a GIL pool for each batch, so no globals are available across batches.

Note however, that `luau` & `luajit` are mutually exclusive features.

Choose `luau` if you want to take advantage of its [sandboxing](https://luau-lang.org/sandbox), [type-checking](https://luau-lang.org/typecheck), [additional operators](https://luau-lang.org/syntax) & [performance innovations](https://luau-lang.org/performance) while [maintaining compatibility with Lua](https://luau-lang.org/compatibility).

Choose `luajit` if its increased performance over `luau` is a priority and you don't need `luau`'s additional features.

`luau` is the default for the prebuilt binaries, with `luajit` as the fallback if `luau` cannot be built for the target architecture.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` | single ascii character to use as delimiter.  Overrides `--delimeter` option. Defaults to "," (comma) for CSV files & "\t" (tab) for TSV files when not set. Note that this will also set the delimiter for qsv's output to stdout.<br>However, using the `--output` option, regardless of this environment variable, will automatically change the delimiter used in the generated file based on the file extension - i.e. comma for `.csv`, tab for `.tsv` & `.tab` files. |
| `QSV_SNIFF_DELIMITER` | if set, the delimiter is automatically detected. Overrides `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` & `--delimiter` option. Note that this does not work with stdin. |
| `QSV_NO_HEADERS` | if set, the first row will **NOT** be interpreted as headers. Supersedes `QSV_TOGGLE_HEADERS`. |
| `QSV_TOGGLE_HEADERS` | if set to `1`, toggles header setting - i.e. inverts qsv header behavior, with no headers being the default, & setting `--no-headers` will actually mean headers will not be ignored. |
| `QSV_AUTOINDEX` | if set, automatically create an index when none is detected. Also automatically updates stale indices. |
| `QSV_COMMENT_CHAR` | set to an ascii character. If set, any lines(including the header) that start with this character are ignored. |
| `QSV_MAX_JOBS` | number of jobs to use for multithreaded commands (currently `apply`, `dedup`, `extsort`, `frequency`, `schema`, `sort`, `split`, `stats`, `tojsonl` & `validate`). If not set, max_jobs is set to the detected number of logical processors.  See [Multithreading](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#multithreading) for more info. |
| `QSV_NO_UPDATE` | if set, prohibit self-update version check for the latest qsv release published on GitHub. |
| `QSV_PREFER_DMY` | if set, date parsing will use DMY format. Otherwise, use MDY format (used with `apply datefmt`, `schema`, `sniff` & `stats` commands). |
| `QSV_REGEX_UNICODE` | if set, makes `search`, `searchset` & `replace` commands unicode-aware. For increased performance, these commands are not unicode-aware by default & will ignore unicode values when matching & will abort when unicode characters are used in the regex. Note that the `apply operations regex_replace` operation is always unicode-aware. |
| `QSV_SKIPUTF8_CHECK` | if set, skip UTF-8 encoding check. Otherwise, for several commands that require UTF-8 encoded input (see [UTF8-Encoding](#utf-8-encoding)), qsv scans the first 8k. |
| `QSV_RDR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` | reader buffer size (default (bytes): 16384) |
| `QSV_WTR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` | writer buffer size (default (bytes): 65536) |
| `QSV_LOG_LEVEL` | desired level (default - off; `error`, `warn`, `info`, `trace`, `debug`). |
| `QSV_LOG_DIR` | when logging is enabled, the directory where the log files will be stored. If the specified directory does not exist, qsv will attempt to create it. If not set, the log files are created in the directory where qsv was started. See [Logging](docs/Logging.md#logging) for more info. |
| `QSV_PROGRESSBAR` | if set, enable the --progressbar option on the `apply`, `fetch`, `fetchpost`, `foreach`, `luau`, `luajit`, `py`, `replace`, `search`, `searchset`, `sortcheck` & `validate` commands.  |
| `QSV_REDIS_CONNSTR` | the `fetch` command can use [Redis](https://redis.io/) to cache responses. Set to connect to the desired Redis instance. (default: `redis:127.0.0.1:6379/1`). For more info on valid Redis connection string formats, see https://docs.rs/redis/latest/redis/#connection-parameters. |
| `QSV_FP_REDIS_CONNSTR` | the `fetchpost` command can also use Redis to cache responses (default: `redis:127.0.0.1:6379/2`). Note that `fetchpost` connects to database 2, as opposed to `fetch` which connects to database 1. |
| `QSV_REDIS_MAX_POOL_SIZE` | the maximum Redis connection pool size. (default: 20). |
| `QSV_REDIS_TTL_SECONDS` | set time-to-live of Redis cached values (default (seconds): 2419200 (28 days)). |
| `QSV_REDIS_TTL_REFRESH`| if set, enables cache hits to refresh TTL of cached values. |

Several dependencies also have environment variables that influence qsv's performance & behavior:

* Memory Management ([mimalloc](https://docs.rs/mimalloc/latest/mimalloc/))   
  When incorporating qsv into a data pipeline that runs in batch mode, particularly with very large CSV files using qsv commands that load entire CSV files into memory, you can
  [fine-tune Mimalloc's behavior using its environment variables](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc#environment-options).
* Network Access ([reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/))   
  qsv uses reqwest for its `fetch`, `validate` & `--update` functions & will honor [proxy settings](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/index.html#proxies) set through the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` & `NO_PROXY` environment variables.
  
> ℹ️ **NOTE:** To get a list of all active qsv-relevant environment variables, run `qsv --envlist`.
Relevant env vars are defined as anything that starts with `QSV_` & `MIMALLOC_` & the proxy variables listed above.

## Feature Flags

`qsv` has several features:

* `mimalloc` (default) - use the mimalloc allocator (see [Memory Allocator](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#memory-allocator) for more info).
* `apply` - enable `apply` command. This swiss-army knife of CSV transformations is very powerful, but it has a lot of dependencies that increases both compile time and binary size.
* `fetch` - enables the `fetch` & `fetchpost` commands.
* `foreach` - enable `foreach` command (not valid for Windows).
* `generate` - enable `generate` command.
* `luau` - enable `luau` command. Embeds a [Luau](https://luau-lang.org) interpreter into qsv. [Luau has type-checking, sandboxing, additional language operators, increased performance & other improvements](https://luau-lang.org/2022/11/04/luau-origins-and-evolution.html) over Lua.
* `luajit` - enable `luajit` command. Embeds a [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/luajit.html) interpreter into qsv. LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time compiler for the Lua 5.2 language & is thus [faster than Luau](https://luajit.org/performance_x86.html). Note that the `luau` & `luajit` interpreters are mutually exclusive features.
* `python` - enable `py` command. Note that qsv will look for the shared library for the Python version (Python 3.6 & above supported) it was compiled against & will abort if the library is not found, even if you're not using the `py` command. Check [Python](#python) section for more info.
* `self_update` - enable self-update engine, checking GitHub for the latest release. Note that if you manually built qsv, `self-update` will only check for new releases.
It will NOT offer the choice to update itself to the prebuilt binaries published on GitHub. You need not worry that your manually built qsv will be overwritten by a self-update.

* `full` - enable to build qsv binary variant which is feature-capable.
* `all_full` - enable to build qsv binary variant with all features enabled (apply,fetch,foreach,generate,luau,python,self_update).
* `lite` - enable to build qsvlite binary variant with all features disabled.
* `datapusher_plus` - enable to build qsvdp binary variant - the [DataPusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus) optimized qsv binary.
* `nightly` - enable to turn on nightly/unstable features in the `rand`, `regex`, `hashbrown`, `parking_lot` & `pyo3` crates when building with Rust nightly/unstable.


> ℹ️ **NOTE:** `qsvlite`, as the name implies, always has **non-default features disabled**. `qsv` can be built with any combination of the above features using the cargo `--features` & `--no-default-features` flags. The prebuilt `qsv` binaries has **all applicable features valid for the target platform**[^7].
