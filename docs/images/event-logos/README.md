# EVENT LOGO ARCHIVE

After Google released [Nano Banana Pro on Nov 20, 2025](https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/), I thought it was high time we modernized [qsv's intentionally kitschy logo](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/discussions/295) with AI.

I did so using the prompt - _Can you create a modern, semi photo-realistic version of this image (referring to the original logo), replacing "CSV DataWrangler" with just "The Blazing-Fast DataWrangler"?_

And it was [amazing](../qsv_logo-gemini-nano-banana.png)! Still kitschy, but not as "eye-hurting" ugly as my amateur illustration.

Given how easy it is - we'll now periodically change the logo to reflect current events/season/holiday, switching back to the base AI-reimagined logo afterwards.

We'll keep an archive of the generated images here along with the prompt used to generate them.
