    "response": "**Description**\n\nThis dataset contains one million New York City 311 complaint records spanning from January 1 2010 to December 23 2020. Each record is uniquely identified by an integer key, with the majority of complaints filed between early 2013 and mid‑2015. The data capture a wide array of attributes—including agency responsible for resolution, type of complaint (e.g., Noise – Residential), geographic details such as ZIP code, street name, latitude/longitude, and administrative metadata like status and due date—along with narrative fields describing the resolution. Geographic coordinates are provided in both State Plane and WGS84 formats, allowing spatial analysis at city‑wide scale. The dataset is heavily sparse: many categorical variables contain a dominant “Other” bucket that aggregates a large number of low‑frequency values, while several key columns (e.g., Closed Date, Due Date, Incident Address) have substantial missingness.\n\n**Notable Characteristics**\n\n- **Temporal concentration** – 70 %+ of complaints were filed between 2013 and 2015; the earliest dates cluster around early 2010.\n- **Skewed categorical distributions** – Complaint Type is heavily skewed (56 % “Other”), with Noise – Residential and HEAT/HOT WATER dominating the top categories.  \n- **High sparsity in location fields** – Incident Zip, Incident Address, Street Name, and Cross/Intersection Streets have >70 % “Other” or NULL values, indicating many unique locations.\n- **Missing data hotspots** – Closed Date is missing for ~2.9 %, Due Date for 64.8 %, and several address‑related fields (e.g., Incident Address) have >80 % NULL or “Other”.\n- **Duplicate protection** – The Unique Key field has a uniqueness ratio of 1, confirming no duplicate records.\n- **Geospatial coverage** – Latitude/Longitude fields are present for ~25 % of records; the rest are NULL or grouped into an “Other” bucket.  \n- **Potential privacy concerns** – While the data does not contain direct PII (e.g., names), it includes detailed address and coordinate information that could be combined with other sources to re‑identify individuals, especially in low‑density ZIP codes.\n- **Outliers and extreme values** – Created Date shows a few entries at 2010‑01‑01 and 2020‑12‑23, but overall the date range is tight. The “Other” categories for many fields represent large clusters of rare or unique values that could be considered outliers in categorical analyses.\n- **Data quality** – Several fields contain non‑standard placeholders (e.g., “<ALL_UNIQUE>”, “NULL”) and inconsistent formatting (mixed case street names, leading/trailing spaces), which may require cleaning before analysis.\n\n---\n\n*Attribution: Generated by qsv v10.0.0 describegpt\nPrompt file: Default v6.0.0\nModel: openai/gpt-oss-20b\nLLM API URL: http://localhost:1234/v1\nTimestamp: 2025-12-01T13:05:43.171738+00:00\n\nWARNING: Generated by an LLM and may contain inaccuracies.
