  "Description": {
    "response": "**Dataset Description**  \nThis 1 million‑row dataset captures New York City 311 complaints filed between January 2010 and December 2020. Each record records a unique complaint identifier, timestamps for creation, resolution, and due dates, the agency and agency name that handled the complaint, the type and descriptor of the issue, the physical location (address, street, borough, ZIP code, latitude/longitude), and ancillary metadata such as the community board, open‑data channel used, and, where applicable, vehicle or bridge‑highway details. The majority of complaints are noise‑related (≈9 %) or classified as “Other” (≈38 %), with the remainder spread across heating, plumbing, street‑light, and parking issues. The dataset is dominated by borough‑wide and residential building locations, with most incidents concentrated in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. Geographic coordinates are provided in both State‑Plane and latitude/longitude, enabling spatial analysis of complaint density and hotspot identification.  \n\n**Notable Characteristics**  \n\n- **High Cardinality & “Other” Categories** – Fields such as `Agency`, `Complaint Type`, `Descriptor`, `Incident Zip`, and `Incident Address` contain many distinct values, with “Other (N)” absorbing the majority of rare categories (e.g., 72 % of ZIP codes, 81 % of addresses).  \n- **Missingness** – `Closed Date` is null in 2.86 % of records, `Due Date` in 64.78 %, and many spatial fields have up to 25 % missing (e.g., `Latitude`, `Longitude`).  \n- **Skewed Distributions** – Complaint type and descriptor are heavily right‑skewed, with single categories capturing a large fraction of records.  \n- **Temporal Concentration** – Created and closed dates cluster around 2013–2015, with a slight left‑skew (negative skewness) indicating a heavier tail toward earlier dates.  \n- **Duplicate / Unique Key** – `Unique Key` is guaranteed unique (1 000 000 distinct values), ensuring no duplicate complaints.  \n- **Potential PII** – Records contain full street addresses and latitude/longitude pairs, which could be considered personally identifying information for location‑based privacy.  \n- **Outliers** – `Closed Date` values span from 1900 to 2100, indicating data entry or system defaults that generate unrealistic timestamps.  \n- **Data Quality Issues** – High proportion of “Other” values, significant missingness in key fields, and extreme timestamp ranges suggest the need for data cleaning and validation before analysis.  \n\n---  \n\n_Footnote: Generated by qsv's describegpt command using openai/gpt-oss-20b on 2025-10-20T00:17:33.504305+00:00_",
    "reasoning": "We need to produce a description of the dataset as a whole, 1-8 sentences. Then a \"Notable Characteristics\" list. Use summary stats and frequency distribution to inform.

Fields: Unique key, timestamps, agency, complaint type, descriptor, location type, zip, address, borough, coordinates, etc. Provide description. Notable: large proportion of missing values in many fields (e.g., Incident Zip 72% other, Incident Address 81% other, etc.), high cardinality fields with unique values. Many \"Other\" categories. Distribution skewness: Complaint type heavily skewed towards \"Other\" (38%), Noise - Residential (9%). Geographic: majority in boroughs and zip. Timestamp ranges 2010-2020. Data quality: many missing/nulls, high cardinality, duplicates? unique key indicates unique records but \"Unique Key\" field has all unique. PII: contains addresses, coordinates, maybe phone numbers? Not in summary. Provide mention.\n\nAlso mention skewness: skewness values for numeric columns? Not specified but we could mention distribution shape: heavy right-skewed for complaint type, etc.\n\nAlso mention outliers: Created Date distribution: skewness -0.0869, so slightly left? Actually negative indicates left skewness? But we can mention distribution of Created Date shows concentration around 2013-2015.\n\nAlso mention missing: Created Date null count 0? Not shown.
