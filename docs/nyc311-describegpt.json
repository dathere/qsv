    "response": "**Dataset Overview**\n\nThe dataset contains **1 000 000** New‑York City 311 complaint records from the first decade of the 21st century (2010‑2020).  \nA single integer “Unique Key” uniquely identifies each row.  Complaint events are recorded with a *Created Date* that ranges from 01 Jan 2010 to 23 Dec 2020, with a mean of 10 Nov 2015 and an inter‑quartile range of roughly 4 years (≈1 460 days).  The corresponding *Closed Date* is available for about 97 % of records; the remaining 3 % are still open.  Nearly all records include the agency that handled the complaint, with NYPD, HPD and DOT together accounting for more than half of the cases.  The most common complaint type is “Noise – Residential” (≈9 % of all complaints), followed by “HEAT/HOT WATER”, “Illegal Parking” and “Blocked Driveway”.  Geographic coordinates are supplied in New‑York State Plane units; latitude/longitude pairs exist for roughly a quarter of the rows.  The dataset contains many high‑cardinality string fields (e.g., *Street Name*, *Cross Street 1*), but most of them are sparse, with 10 – 30 % non‑null values and frequent “Other” placeholders.  \n\n**Notable Characteristics**\n\n- **High uniqueness ratio**: Most categorical fields (Agency, Complaint Type, Descriptor) have a cardinality close to the number of rows, indicating many unique or rarely repeated values.\n- **Sparse location data**: Only about 25 % of records include latitude/longitude; the rest rely on ZIP code or address strings that are often incomplete.\n- **Missing dates**: ~2.9 % of *Closed Date* and ~64.8 % of *Due Date* are null, reflecting open complaints or missing scheduling information.\n- **“Other” buckets** dominate many fields (e.g., “Other (N)” for Incident Zip, Street Name, etc.), masking a large number of distinct values that could be useful if expanded.\n- **Temporal concentration**: The highest volume of filings occurs in the first quarter of 2013 and 2014, with a noticeable drop during 2020‑2021 likely due to COVID‑19 restrictions.\n- **Potential data quality issues**: inconsistent string formatting (mixed case, leading/trailing spaces), placeholder dates such as “1900‑01‑01” or “2100‑01‑01”, and the presence of nulls in critical fields (*Closed Date*, *Due Date*, *Address*).  \n- **PII/PHI risk**: The dataset includes street addresses, ZIP codes, and borough names; these should be treated as potentially identifying.  \n- **Duplicates**: No duplicates on the primary key, but high cardinality suggests many unique complaints with minimal repetition.\n\n\nGenerated by qsvlite v11.0.2 describegpt\nCommand line: target/debug/qsvlite describegpt --all /tmp/NYC_311_SR_2010-2020-sample-1M.csv --format json --fresh -o nyc311-describegpt.json\nPrompt file: Default v7.0.0\nModel: openai/gpt-oss-20b\nLLM API URL: http://localhost:1234/v1\nTimestamp: 2025-12-15T12:19:20.925736+00:00\n\nWARNING: Generated by an LLM and may contain inaccuracies.
