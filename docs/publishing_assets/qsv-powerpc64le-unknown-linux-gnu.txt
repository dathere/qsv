Compiled natively with target-cpu=native on a native PowerPC runner generously provided by IBM.

See https://github.com/IBM/actionspz/issues/47

The polars feature, unfortunately, does not compile on PowerPC and is disabled.

Further, qsvdp is not built as DataPusher+, currently, is not deployed on PowerPC platforms.
