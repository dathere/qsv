"""Build examples/viz/northeast_states.{geojson,csv} from US Census Bureau data.

Eleven Northeast states -- MD, DE, PA, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH, ME -- with real TIGER
boundaries, colored in the gallery by population density.

- northeast_states.geojson: the TIGERweb response, unmodified except for a deterministic
  feature sort and one-feature-per-line formatting. properties keeps STUSAB (matched by
  `--feature-id-key properties.STUSAB`), NAME (auto-detected for hover labels), AREALAND
  and AREAWATER.
- northeast_states.csv: state,people_per_sq_mi -- two columns, matching the sibling
  fixture us_state_stats.csv. Density is DERIVED (see below); it is not a published
  Census column.

people_per_sq_mi = POPESTIMATE2024 / (AREALAND / 2589988.110336)

AREALAND is TIGER land area in square meters, excluding water, so this is land-area
density -- the conventional definition. It stays auditable straight from the committed
fixtures: multiply a CSV density by the matching feature's properties.AREALAND (converted
to square miles) to recover the population.

Boundaries are requested with maxAllowableOffset=0.002 degrees, which is ArcGIS
server-side simplification. Full resolution is 4.9 MB -- far too heavy to commit and
pointless for a tile map. 0.002 lands at ~70 KB and still preserves Cape Cod, Long
Island, the Chesapeake and the Maine coast; 0.005 (33 KB) visibly coarsens all four.

Works of the US Census Bureau are US Government works in the PUBLIC DOMAIN under
17 U.S.C. section 105 -- attribution is NOT legally required. (Contrast gen_world_cities.py,
whose GeoNames input is CC BY 4.0 and *does* require it.) The sources are recorded anyway,
here and in examples/viz/README.md ("Data sources & licensing") and the repository-root
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md -- keep all three in step if this script's inputs change.

Do NOT switch to api.census.gov: it now rejects keyless requests with "Missing Key". Both
URLs above are keyless static/REST endpoints, which is why this script self-fetches instead
of taking pre-downloaded paths the way gen_world_cities.py does.
